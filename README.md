# Fruits_Veg_Model
Image Classification Model for Fruits and Vegetables

## Description
The fruits and Vegetable model is a model that has been trained to identify different images 
of fruits and Vegetables, when you pass a jpeg image into it.

### Features 
- Classifies a wide range of fruits and Vegetables
- Used a pretrained model from Tensorflow with notes
- Has a very high accuracy for common fruits and Vegetables
- Gives info about accuracy after input to show how well model is preforming

## Files
The first file is ML-fruits-Project.ipynb this file has all the code i used for creating the model
using Jupyter Notebook.
You can run the file yourself to save the actual model in your computer 

## Installation 
for running on localhost
- Make sure you have a working version of python installed into your computer
- install Jupyter Notebook
- run the ML-fruits-Project.ipynb that you see in this repository
- after that you should have a file called (image.classify.keras) #Training will take time
- install Visual Studio Code
- clone this repository and add (image.classify.keras) into the clone
- install Streamlit 
- open visual studio with the clone you got from get hub and run (Streamlit run app.py) in Terminal

## Usage
After opening Visual Studio Code and typing (Streamlit run app.py) in Terminal
a web app should appear in your localhost####, then download or take a picture of 
a fruit or Vegetable save it as a jpg file and write the path name in the input box Example below

## DataSet
I downloaded over 10k pictures of fruits and Vegetables and divided them into train, test and Validation
dataset, to many pictures to upload into github so you can use Kaggle Datasets or googles open image
datasets
